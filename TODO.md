Here I keep some things that i can forget to do:

- [ ] Zsh syntax highlight, autosuggestions, substring search
- [ ] Rewrite config.scm to use channels from channels.scm.
- [ ] Doom Emacs good integration
- [ ] Move all dotfiles and configs from NixOS config
- [ ] Package all things i need
- [ ] Make Nix fully declarative and integrate with Guix
