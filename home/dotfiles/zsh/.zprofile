# Keep this file empty to prevent errors when sourcing '/etc/profile'

# In this config '/etc/profile' is sourced in '.zshrc' only after 'setopt no_nomatch' and outside the Guix shell,  
# which prevents the error:  
# '/etc/profile:65: no matches found: /etc/profile.d/*.sh'.

# Also my approach resolves Guix shell issues during SSH sessions to ensure proper behavior.  
# The underlying cause may be the zsh home service, which is not used here,  
# yet it triggers this file to be set to 'source /etc/profile'.

# More details about SSH issue can be found at: https://issues.guix.gnu.org/66168
