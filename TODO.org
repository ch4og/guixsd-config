#+TITLE: TODOs for Guix System Config

Here I keep some things that I might forget to do:

* TODO Zsh: syntax highlighting, autosuggestions, substring search
* TODO Rewrite =config.scm= to use channels from =channels.scm=
* TODO Doom Emacs: good integration
* TODO Move all dotfiles and configs from NixOS config
* TODO Package all tools and utilities I need
* TODO Make Nix fully declarative and integrate with Guix
