#+TITLE: TODOs for Guix System Config

Here I keep some things that I might forget to do:

Rewrite =bin/config= to use channels from =modules/channels.scm=
Move all dotfiles and configs from NixOS config
Package all tools and utilities I need
Make Nix fully declarative and integrate with Guix
Quickshell
Ssh agent
Emacs
Ksh
nekoray
move waybar to wm config
