#+TITLE: TODOs for Guix System Config

Here I keep some things that I might forget to do:

Zsh: syntax highlighting, autosuggestions, substring search
Rewrite =config.scm= to use channels from =channels.scm=
Move all dotfiles and configs from NixOS config
Package all tools and utilities I need
Make Nix fully declarative and integrate with Guix
Quickshell
